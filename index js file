import React from "react";

import App from "./App";
import * as serviceWorker from "./serviceWorker";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { PersistGate } from "redux-persist/integration/react";
import { applyMiddleware, createStore, compose } from "redux";

//import store from "./store/Store";

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer, composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(logger, thunk))
);
//console.log(rootReducer)
const persistor = persistStore(store);
//<PersistGate persistor={persistor}>
//<App/>
//</PersistGate>
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
  <PersistGate persistor={persistor}>

// If you want your app to work offline and load faster, you can change
// unregister() to register() below. Note this comes with some pitfalls.

serviceWorker.register();
